##Introduction （https://fanyi.baidu.com Chinese to English)

-Support HDMI implementation of Intel i915 on HASWELL platform (i7-4700HQ) under Linux 5.4 LTS version 4k@30Hz The resolution. My laptop is already very old, and coupled with being unemployed, I cannot afford a new one. As a programmer with over 50 years of experience, it's quite difficult to find another job, and this old laptop (i7-4700HQ) can still compete. The laptop is installed with the ArchLinux operating system. With the upgrade of the kernel version, the broadcom wl driver for the wireless network card has started to have problems, often causing OOPs and requiring uninstallation and reloading. At this time, there are two options: one is to modify the broadcom wl driver, but this driver has always existed in the form of dkms, and it is estimated that the difficulty of modification is not small. Another option is to roll back the kernel version, which is relatively simple, just find an LTS version. I chose LTS54 because I am familiar with this version and it is relatively stable. The only issue with this kernel currently is that i915 does not support HDMI 4k@30Hz Mode, maximum can only 1920@60Hz The amount of data transmitted in these two modes is the same, it's not a bandwidth issue. After testing, it was found that i915 supports LTS61 4k@30Hz After careful consideration, it has been decided to refer to LTS61 and have LTS54 support it 4k@30Hz There are also two options, one is to port the i915 driver of LTS61 backwards, but after starting, I found it difficult and gave up. One way is to modify the i915 driver of LTS54. After comparison, it was found that the problem should be with the 297MHz clock, which should be feasible. I just separated the i915 driver and made it into a dkms. Due to my first encounter with GPU related parts, it was still a bit complicated. After several days of modification, the functionality has been implemented and no problems have been found in use.
##Use
-Copy i915-54 to the/etc/src directory and then execute dkms build -m i915 -v 54，dkms install -m i915 -v 54，mkinitcpio -p linux-lts54， Just restart.
